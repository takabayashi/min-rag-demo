# Machine Learning Overview

Machine Learning (ML) is a subset of artificial intelligence that enables computers to learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed.

## Types of Machine Learning

### Supervised Learning
- Uses labeled training data
- Learns mapping from inputs to outputs
- Examples: Classification, Regression
- Algorithms: Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, SVM

### Unsupervised Learning
- Works with unlabeled data
- Finds hidden patterns in data
- Examples: Clustering, Dimensionality Reduction
- Algorithms: K-Means, PCA, DBSCAN

### Reinforcement Learning
- Learns through interaction with environment
- Receives rewards or penalties for actions
- Examples: Game playing, Robotics
- Algorithms: Q-Learning, Policy Gradient

## Common Applications
- Image recognition
- Natural language processing
- Recommendation systems
- Fraud detection
- Autonomous vehicles
- Medical diagnosis
