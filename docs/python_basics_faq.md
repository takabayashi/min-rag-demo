# Python Basics FAQ

## What is Python?

Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its simplicity and readability. It was created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991.

## What are Python's key features?

Python features include dynamic typing, automatic memory management, extensive standard library, and support for multiple programming paradigms including procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming.

## How do I install Python?

You can download Python from python.org or use package managers like conda. Most systems come with Python pre-installed.

## What is the difference between Python 2 and Python 3?

Python 3 is the current version with improved features, while Python 2 reached end-of-life in 2020. Python 3 has better Unicode support and cleaner syntax.

## How do I write a "Hello World" program in Python?

```python
print("Hello, World!")
```

## What are variables in Python?

Variables are containers for storing data values. In Python, you don't need to declare variable types explicitly.

## What are the basic data types in Python?

Python has several basic data types: integers, floats, strings, booleans, lists, tuples, dictionaries, and sets.

## How do I create a list in Python?

```python
my_list = [1, 2, 3, "hello"]
```

## What is a tuple in Python?

A tuple is an immutable sequence of elements, created using parentheses: `(1, 2, 3)`.

## How do I create a dictionary?

```python
my_dict = {"key": "value", "name": "John"}
```

## What is the difference between a list and a tuple?

Lists are mutable (can be changed), while tuples are immutable (cannot be changed after creation).

## How do I check the type of a variable?

Use the `type()` function: `type(variable_name)`.

## What are Python functions?

Functions are reusable blocks of code that perform specific tasks. They are defined using the `def` keyword.

## How do I define a function in Python?

```python
def greet(name):
    return f"Hello, {name}!"
```

## What are default parameters in functions?

Default parameters allow you to specify default values for function arguments.

## What is the difference between `==` and `is`?

`==` compares values, while `is` compares object identity (memory location).

## How do I handle exceptions in Python?

Use try-except blocks to handle exceptions gracefully.

## What is a module in Python?

A module is a file containing Python code that can be imported and used in other programs.

## How do I import a module?

Use the `import` statement: `import module_name` or `from module_name import function_name`.

## What is the Python standard library?

The standard library is a collection of modules that come with Python installation, providing common functionality.
